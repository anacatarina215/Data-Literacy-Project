# Data-Literacy-Project

First, was executed an processing of the data set (in the folder data - WorldCups.csv, WorldCupMatches.csv and WorldCupPlayers.csv) on "Data_Processing.ipynb", adding the information of the World Cup 2018 and 2022 (in the folder data - WM_2018_2022.csv), resulting in the data WorldCups_complete.csv and WordlCupMatches_complete.csv.
The data WorldCupPlayers.csv are part of the data set downloaded from kaggle but it was not used.

Secondly, the data sets created were analysed and was also found out which variable was more correlated with the wins (in "Data_Analysis.ipynb") to then be done a prediction method (in "Prediction_Method.ipynb") of the World Cup 2022 winner based on that variable.

Note that for this, was first created an environment with python=3.10, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn, pandas and jupyterlab.
